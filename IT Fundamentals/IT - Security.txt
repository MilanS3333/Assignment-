Computer security refers to the protection of computer systems and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, or destruction, employing measures such as encryption, firewalls, antivirus software, and user authentication.



2. What are the modes of security in computer?
ANS.

The modes of security in computer systems include preventive measures (e.g., firewalls, access controls), detective measures (e.g., intrusion detection systems), corrective measures (e.g., patching, incident response), and recovery measures (e.g., data backups, disaster recovery plans).



3. What is physical security?
ANS.

Physical security refers to measures taken to protect physical assets, facilities, and resources from unauthorized access, damage, theft, or harm. It includes physical barriers, surveillance systems, access controls, and security personnel.

5. What is firewall and its types?
ANS.

6. What is the difference between physical firewall and software firewall?
ANS.


A physical firewall is a hardware device placed between networks to control traffic, while a software firewall is a program installed on a computer or server that monitors and filters network traffic locally.



7. What is application software security in OS?
ANS.

Application software security in an operating system refers to the measures and mechanisms implemented to protect applications from security threats, such as vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious attacks. This can include secure coding practices, access controls, encryption, and regular software updates.
